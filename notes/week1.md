# What is a BIT?

*The 'smallest' unit of information we can represent* (ignore partial bits for now)
In Layman's terms, the **The answer to a Yes / No question**

### Examples:
- 0 or 1
- Yes or No

### Basic Usage:

You quantify the amount of things that can be represented with **Bits** by understanding that Binary is a Base-2 representation of information

*Ergo:*

- 5 bits results in 2^5 things possible to represent or 32 things


# Data are agnostic

What does this mean?

*It means they are general until otherwized specified*

# Representing with Bits
AKA: **Encoding**

You can use:
- Numbers
- Positive Integers

## Example:

*Positive Integers*

- 0000 -> 0
- 0001 -> 1
- 0010 -> 2
- 0011 -> 3

## Understanding Base - 2

0001 = 2^3 * 0 + 2^2 * 0 + 2^1 * 0 + 2^0 * 1 = 1

# Defintions:

* **Binary** : Composed of 2 states
* **Boolean**: True or False
* **Digital**: Composed of Discrete Elements
* **Analog** : Composed of Continous Elements
