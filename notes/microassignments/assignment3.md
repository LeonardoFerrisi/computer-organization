# Assignment 3

Assume that X consists of 3 bits, x2 x1 x0, and Y consists of 3 bits, y2 y1 y0. Write logic
functions and design circuits that are true if and only if. You do not need to provide truth tables.
HINT: You may find it very useful to work out the logic for two-bit numbers first (in particular, the logic
for 2-bit unsigned numbers comes into play when using 3-bit signed numbers). You may use logisim to test your circuits.

* X < Y, where X and Y are thought of as unsigned 3-bit binary numbers
